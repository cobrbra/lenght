The goal of `lenght` is to provide convenient aliases for each of the
common misspellings of the R function `length`, a problem that haunts us
all.

## Authors

*Creators* and *contributors*: Isabella Deutsch, Jacob Bradley<br>
*Maintainer*: Jacob Bradley

## Installation

You can install the development version of `lenght` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("cobrbra/lenght")
```

or via CRAN with

``` r
install.packages("lenght")
```

## Usage

The intended use of this package is in the ideation stage of a project.
It allows the user to code seamlessly without pesky typos interrupting
the workflow. It also focuses debugging on more relevant errors in the
code. Partially inspired by an authorâ€™s minor struggles with dyslexia.

We recommend editing code intended for production or publication such
that it successfully runs without this package.

## Example

You can use the functions in `lenght` to do anything the base R function
`length` would do.

``` r
library(lenght)
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'lenght'
#> The following object is masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     length
print(lenght(1:4))
#> [1] 4

print(lentgh(options()))
#> [1] 72

print(lenhgt(NULL))
#> [1] 0
```
